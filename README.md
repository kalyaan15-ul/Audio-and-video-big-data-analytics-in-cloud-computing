# Audio and Video Big Data Analytics in Cloud Computing

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **audio and video data** can be analyzed efficiently using **cloud computing platforms**. Audio and video files generate large volumes of data, and processing them on local systems can be slow and resource‑intensive. By leveraging cloud environments, we can scale computation, handle large datasets, and perform advanced analytics more efficiently.

The project is implemented as a **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** and focuses on practical techniques for multimedia data analysis using Python.

##  Objectives

* Understand the challenges of **audio and video big data**
* Perform **data preprocessing** on multimedia files
* Extract meaningful **features from audio and video**
* Analyze multimedia data using **Python libraries**
* Demonstrate how **cloud computing** supports scalable analytics
